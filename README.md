## Title: Identifying defects during semiconductor manufacturing using Machine Learning
IoT is networking of physical devices and computers which  enables them to collect and share data. 
The collected data is  usually aggregated and stored on cloud platforms. 
IoT allows  remote sensing and monitoring of these devices. 
This  internetworking and connectivity is allowing automation in  various fields.
One such great example is that of industrial IoT (IIoT). The 
IoT enabled manufacturing systems enable monitoring of vital 
machine data and controlling the machine using various signals. 
This helps to improve the manufacturing process and helps to 
plan maintenance activities of the machines.
